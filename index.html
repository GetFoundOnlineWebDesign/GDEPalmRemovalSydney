  <h1>Palm Removal Sydney | Professional Palm Tree Removal &amp; Cleaning</h1>

  <p>Palms can look fantastic in Sydney gardens, but when they’re poorly placed, overgrown or poorly maintained they quickly become a headache. Falling fronds, messy seed pods, slippery driveways and hard-to-manage heights can all create safety risks and constant maintenance for property owners.</p>

  <p>GDE Tree Services Sydney provides safe, efficient <strong>palm removal Sydney</strong> and palm cleaning for homes, strata complexes, body corporates and commercial sites across Greater Sydney. Backed by a Level 5 arborist and a large fleet of equipment, we handle everything from a single backyard palm through to large rows of established palms.</p>

  <h2>Palm Removal &amp; Palm Cleaning Services</h2>

  <p>Our experienced team offers a full range of palm tree services, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Complete <strong>palm tree removal</strong> – including difficult and tall palms</li>
    <li>Palm cleaning – removing old fronds, boots and dead material</li>
    <li>Seed pod removal to reduce mess and unwanted self-seeding</li>
    <li>Sectional dismantling of palms near houses, pools, fences and powerlines</li>

  </ul>

  <p>All work is carried out to Australian standards with appropriate equipment, rigging and safety procedures for tight-access and complex sites.</p>

  <h2>When Should You Remove a Palm Tree?</h2>

  <p>Palms are often removed or heavily cleaned when they start to cause problems such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Regularly dropping heavy fronds onto roofs, cars or footpaths</li>
    <li>Seed pods creating constant mess on driveways, pools and outdoor areas</li>
    <li>Palms outgrowing the space and leaning towards houses or powerlines</li>
    <li>Roots causing damage to paving, retaining walls or underground services</li>
    <li>Habitat for pests such as rats, ibis or bats</li>
    <li>Insurance or safety concerns identified by property managers or body corporates</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you’re unsure whether a palm needs removal or can simply be cleaned and maintained, GDE’s Level 5 arborist can inspect the tree and provide practical recommendations.</p>
